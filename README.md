# Timeywimey

## Description

Timeywimey is a collection of libraries providing conversion utilities for JodaTime, Legacy `java.util.Date`, and Java 8 `java.time` classes.

`timeywimey-core` provides Java static methods for the conversion logic usable in both Java 8 and Scala.

`timeywimey-scala` includes Scala implicits to provide syntactic sugars `.asJava` and `.asJoda`. (TBD)
